# GrouCord (Group Coordinator App)

- **GrouCord** is an application developed to enhance planning, management, and coordination within a group, facilitating the creation of group projects and streamlining other collaborative activities.
- This app offers a **straightforward** and **intuitive** approach, simplifying group creation, communication, and collaboration. 
- This app allows users to focus on their group work by **minimizing distractions**, such as **irrelevant chats** and other non-essential communications that can lead to confusion and forgetfulness.
- This app was made for anyone making a team, either in school, public service, or business.
- This app is especially helpful for team leaders, empowering them to plan the team's actions effectively. It addresses a common problem faced by leaders: scheduling appointments where only a few team members attend.
- This is also gives convenience to the members as they can share and let the team know when and why they're busy so that the team can plan or talk it out ahead of time.

## Database Model
![ERD Model](Resources/erd_final_1.png "ERD Model")
- This ERD presents a model for **GrouCord** which I used to offer a comprehensive view of its entities and relationships. Below is a breakdown of the entities and their attributes:

### Entities:

#### Account:
- Represents individuals or user interacting with the system.
- Attributes include `accountId` (primary key), `email`, `password`, `username`, `contactNumber`, `status`, and `accountProfile`.

#### Group:
- Represents each group.
- Attributes consist of `groupID` (primary key), `groupName`, `groupLeader`, and `groupImage`.

#### GroupMember:
- Represents members within a group.
- Attributes include `groupMemberID` (primary key), `groupMemberEmail`,  and `groupID` which is a foreign key referencing Group's groupID.

#### Task:
- This represent and holds each task made within a group.
- Attributes comprise `taskID` (primary key), `description`, `taskName`, `dueDate`, `Remarks`, `link`, and `groupMemberID` which is a foreign key referencing GroupMember's groupMemberID.

#### SubmittedTask:
- this holds submitted tasks in response to the tasks assigned to a member.
- Attributes include `submittedTaskID` (primary key), `fileLink`, `description`, `dateSubmitted`, and `taskID` which is a foreign key referencing Task's taskID.

#### BusySched:
- Accumulates all of the busy schedules provided by the members of the group.
- Attributes consist of `busySchedID` (primary key), `date`, `description`, and `groupMemberID` which is a foreign key referencing GroupMember's groupMemberID.

#### Announcement:
- stores the announcements created by the leader.
- Attributes include `announcementID` (primary key), `announcementHead`, `announcementBody`, `isLatest`, `datePosted`, and `AGroupID` which is a foreign key referencing Group's groupID.

#### Status:
- stores the corresponding status image to a user's current status for display.
- Attributes comprise `statusID` (primary key), `state` and `statPic`. 


### Relationships:

- An *Account* can have one to many Groups.
- A *Group* can only be led by one *Account*.
- A *Group* can have one to many *GroupMembers*, Yet a *GroupMember* can only have one *Group*.
- A *GroupMember* can only have one *Account*.
- A *GroupMember* can have one to many *BusySched* and one to many *Task*.
- A *Group* can have one to many *Announcement* but an *Announcement* is only for one group. 


## Events Documentation

## System Design
![System Design](Resources/SystemDesign.png "System Design")
- These were the classes used on developing this app. I have created a class named `DBManager` and `GroupHandler` that will execute all the queries from my GUI forms, where `GroupHandler` is for queries related to a group while `DBManager` is for the rest, for an effecient and easy debugging.  

## How to Use the App?

### Prerequisite

#### MySql Server
![MySql Server](Resources/MySql_Download.png "MySql Server")
- You should have a **MySql community server**. If you don't have it, you can download it from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). Follow the setup process and install it.

#### Download Resources
![Release Download](Resources/Reslease_Download.png "Release Download")
- Visit [this link](https://github.com/VSUrhuel/Mabolo-Dormitory-System/releases) to download the latest release version of this app. Click the **latest** `.msi` file to download it. 

![Database Download](Resources/Database_Download.png "Database Download")

- Congratulations! You have finished setting up MySql! Scroll down for more!

### Set Up Environment Variables
![Environment Variables](Resources/EnvironmentVariables.png "Environment Variables")
- In Windows search, look for `environment variables` settings. In `system variables`, click `add`.

- Add these three `variable names` individually: `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_SERVER`, `MYSQL_USERNAME` (follow these names strictly), and set their values to the corresponding values you entered when setting up your database.

![Information](Resources/Info.png "Information")
- If you forgot your server and username, you can view them by opening your database in workbench, clicking `server`, and going to `Manage Access Settings` > `Connection`.

- The variable value for `MYSQL_PASSWORD` is the password you entered when you first used MySql. You can view or change it by opening your database in workbench and navigating to `server` > `User and Privileges`.

### Install
- Run the installation process downloaded from [this GitHub link](https://github.com/VSUrhuel/Mabolo-Dormitory-System/releases/tag/System). **You can now use the app!**

## How to Open Using Visual Studio?
![VS](Resources/vs.png "VS")
- Click `code` at the top and select `Open with Visual Studio`.

- To fully utilize this, download various NutGet extensions, including but not limited to `MySql`, `Xunit`, and `MySql Connector`. These can be easily downloaded in NutGet Packages.

- For `GunaUI`, **DO NOT** download it from NutGet package. Manually download the `dll` file and add it to the project's references. You can download the `GunaUI.dll` from this repository.
